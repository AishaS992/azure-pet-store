## Setting up Bing Search and querying the API ##

## Step1 ##

Head to Azure Portal and Search for "Bing" Select Bing Resources and create a new "Bing Search" Resource.

> üìù Please Note, I chose Bing Search vs Bing Custom Search. While Bing Web Search API allows you to search over the entire web, Bing Custom Search allows you to select the slices of the web that you want to search over and control the ranking when searching over your targeted web space. For this tutorial Bing Search us sufficient.

Give your new Bing Search Resource a name, subscription, pricing tier, resource group and acknowledge/consent and click "Create"

> üìù Please Note, I chose the Free Pricing Tier, you can only select this option one time, so keep that in mind if you have multiple Bing Search Resources. This was sufficient for the purposes of this guide. You will want to consider the frequency in which you will be invoking the Bing Search API and choose accordingly.
